<h1>Introduction to Front-End Development</h1>

<h2>Front-End Development is comprised of 3 main languages you need to learn:</h2>

1. HTML, The backbone.
2. CSS, The styling.
3. JavaScript, The life-giver.


- HTML:
  HTML is basically the tool to shape out the skeleton of your website.
  
  Pay Attention to: 
  - Tags
  - Attributes
  - Links
  - Images
  - Tables
  - Layouts
  
  
  
- CSS:
  CSS is a tool that lets you experiment with the styling of every item that exists in your website.
  
  Pay Attention to: 
  - Basics
  - Selectors
  - Declarations
  - Property
  - Value
  
  
  
- JavaScript:
  JS is the tool that gives life to your website, defining the function behind every action.
  
  Pay Attention to:
  - BasicJS (No frameworks for now (: )
  - Datatypes: String, Number, Arrays, Objects, etc.
  - Functions: Conditionals, Loops, Operators, etc.
  - Event handling
  - JSON
  
  
I recently read an [article](https://dev.to/methodx/the-best-way-to-learn-how-to-code-14lk) on [DEV](https://dev.to) which outlines that there are 3 stages one should follow in order to learn how to code and I can't help but find this advice quite insightful and helpful. The 3 stages are namely : 
- Learn Syntax
- Solve Problems
- Make stuff

<h3> Learn Syntax </h3>
<p1>The best and most popular way to learn a new language is by enrolling on a free course/tutorial. This approach has both pros and cons. The advantages are mostly their beginner friendly design, hands-on experience with examples and challenges as well as the ease of use. One though must pay attention so as not to be patronized and consumed in the heap of begginer's guides, tutorials and challenges that are out there. More specifically, it is a common occurence that a learner feels that he/she is not ready to start a small project of their own and this is further supported through tutorials and guides that don't encourage a person to make an attempt. In order to avoid falling in this quagmire my personal suggestion coincides with the views expressed in the aforementioned article which is to enroll in a couple at most tutorials or courses to acclimatize yourselves with the syntax, read one or two books if you are interested to learn a little extra and proceed to the next step. You are ready! Believe in you!</p1>
  
  

There is a vast variety of sites that offer such tutorials and below is a list that I have either personally done or have come accross through posts, suggestions or hearsay:
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [MIMO](https://getmimo.com/)
- Or enroll on an online course (paid or free) by a well known University:
  - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
  - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
  - [Edx](https://www.edx.org/)

and a lot more to be found...

<h3> Solve Problems </h3>
<p1> Here is where you reap the fruits of your efforts! Personally , I find this section the most rewarding. After enduring all those fill in the gap / missing line of code homework and painfully trying to memorize all these predetermined keywords, you can finally put what you' ve learned to good use. It's not going to be easy , you're supposed to refer back to every little thing you forgot how to use but trust me when I say this, this is exactly what you're going to do in your whole developer career. Better get used to it the earliest you can. </p1>
If you are like me and have a lack of things to challenge yourself with and create then, 
[Edabit](https://edabit.com/) is an excellent collection of challenges in a variety of languages that will help you find small projects to attempt. There are also solutions and questions/comments from other users who have attempted the same challenges from which you can draw inspiration. All in all a great tool!
